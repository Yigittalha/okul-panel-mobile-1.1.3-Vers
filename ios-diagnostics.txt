Running 17 checks on your project...
13/17 checks passed. 4 checks failed. Possible issues detected:
Use the --verbose flag to see more details about passed checks.

✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Error validating fields in /Users/yigit/Desktop/okul-panel-mobile-updated.v6-main/app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'notification'.
Advice:
Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/

✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-font
Required by: @expo/vector-icons
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-font"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, plugins. 


✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.24.0 - expected version: 2.1.2
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
